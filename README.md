# rodep is no longer maintained.
I don't have the time or interest to work on rodep anymore. It's broken in several ways and doesn't support Rojo's new project format. Some items on Rojo's roadmap will make rodep obsolete soon, as well. This repository has been archived for historical purposes.

# rodep
An **extremely early** project for adding dependencies to Roblox projects that use Rojo and Git.

What works right now:
* Adding submodules from GitHub
* Adding submodules to `rojo.json` automatically

What will work later (I hope):
* Updating submodules easily
